# Stripe Billing Integration Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented a complete Stripe billing integration for the Crow's Eye Website project, enabling subscription-based monetization with three paid tiers and BYOK (Bring Your Own Key) discount functionality.

## Implementation Components

### 1. Core Libraries

#### `src/lib/stripe.ts`
- **STRIPE_PRODUCTS mapping**: Defines three paid subscription tiers (Creator, Growth, Pro Agency) with regular and BYOK pricing
- **Helper functions**:
  - `getStripeProduct()`: Retrieves product configuration by tier and BYOK status
  - `createCheckoutSession()`: Creates Stripe checkout sessions with proper metadata
  - `createCustomerPortalSession()`: Generates customer portal sessions for subscription management
  - `getSubscriptionTierFromPriceId()`: Maps Stripe price IDs back to tier names
  - `formatPrice()`: Utility for price formatting

#### `src/lib/subscription.ts`
- **UserSubscription interface**: Defines subscription data structure
- **Firebase integration functions**:
  - `getUserSubscription()`: Fetches user subscription from Firestore
  - `updateUserSubscription()`: Updates subscription data in Firestore
  - `getSubscriptionFeatures()`: Returns feature limits based on tier
  - `hasFeatureAccess()`: Checks if user has access to specific features

### 2. API Routes

#### `/api/stripe/checkout` (POST)
- Creates Stripe checkout sessions for subscription purchases
- Accepts tier, BYOK status, user ID, and email
- Returns checkout session URL for redirect
- Includes proper error handling and validation

#### `/api/stripe/webhook` (POST)
- Handles Stripe webhook events for subscription lifecycle management
- Processes events:
  - `checkout.session.completed`
  - `customer.subscription.created`
  - `customer.subscription.updated`
  - `customer.subscription.deleted`
  - `invoice.payment_succeeded`
  - `invoice.payment_failed`
- Updates Firebase user records with subscription status
- Includes comprehensive logging and error handling

#### `/api/stripe/portal` (POST)
- Creates Stripe customer portal sessions
- Allows users to manage billing, update payment methods, cancel subscriptions
- Redirects back to account page after management

### 3. Frontend Components

#### `src/hooks/useStripeCheckout.ts`
- Custom React hook for handling Stripe checkout flow
- Manages loading states and error handling
- Integrates with authentication context
- Redirects unauthenticated users to sign-in page

#### Updated `src/app/pricing/page.tsx`
- Integrated with Stripe checkout system
- Replaced static download links with dynamic subscription buttons
- Added BYOK discount detection and display
- Includes error handling and loading states
- Differentiates between free, paid, and enterprise tiers

#### Updated `src/app/account/page.tsx`
- Complete subscription management dashboard
- Displays current subscription status and features
- Integrates with Stripe customer portal
- Shows subscription details, billing dates, and plan features
- Handles success messages from checkout completion
- Provides upgrade/downgrade options

### 4. Subscription Tiers

#### Spark (Free)
- $0/month
- 1 social account, 50 AI credits, basic features
- No Stripe integration required

#### Creator ($19/month, $13 with BYOK)
- 3 social accounts, 300 AI credits, email support
- Stripe Price ID: `price_creator_monthly` / `price_creator_monthly_byok`

#### Growth ($49/month, $34 with BYOK)

- Stripe Price ID: `price_growth_monthly` / `price_growth_monthly_byok`

#### Pro Agency ($89/month, $62 with BYOK)
- 15 social accounts, 1000 AI credits, advanced features
- Stripe Price ID: `price_pro_monthly` / `price_pro_monthly_byok`

#### Enterprise (Custom)
- Unlimited features, dedicated support
- Contact sales flow (no Stripe integration)

## Key Features

### BYOK (Bring Your Own Key) Discount
- 30% discount for users who provide their own OpenAI/Gemini API keys
- Automatically detected via localStorage or environment variables
- Separate Stripe price IDs for BYOK variants
- Visual indicators on pricing page and account dashboard

### Subscription Management
- Complete lifecycle management through Stripe webhooks
- Real-time status updates in Firebase
- Proper handling of subscription states (active, past_due, cancelled, trialing)
- Cancel at period end functionality
- Automatic downgrade to free tier on cancellation

### User Experience
- Seamless checkout flow with Stripe-hosted pages
- Success/error message handling
- Loading states throughout the application
- Responsive design for all screen sizes
- Clear feature comparison and pricing display

### Security & Reliability
- Webhook signature verification
- Proper error handling and logging
- Build-time compatibility with dynamic imports
- TypeScript type safety throughout
- Graceful fallbacks for missing data

## Environment Variables Required

```env
# Stripe Configuration
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_...
STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_...
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_...

# Firebase Configuration (already configured)
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=...
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=...
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=...
# ... other Firebase vars
```

## Stripe Dashboard Setup Required

1. **Products & Prices**: Create products and prices matching the IDs in `STRIPE_PRODUCTS`
2. **Webhooks**: Configure webhook endpoint pointing to `/api/stripe/webhook`
3. **Customer Portal**: Enable customer portal in Stripe dashboard
4. **Test Mode**: Ensure proper test/live mode configuration

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Pricing page displays correctly with BYOK detection
- [ ] Checkout flow works for all paid tiers
- [ ] Webhook events properly update Firebase
- [ ] Account page shows subscription status
- [ ] Customer portal integration works
- [ ] Success/error states display properly
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness verified
- [ ] Build process completes without errors

## Next Steps

1. **Stripe Dashboard Configuration**: Set up products, prices, and webhooks in Stripe
2. **Testing**: Comprehensive testing with Stripe test cards
3. **Production Deployment**: Configure production Stripe keys and webhook endpoints
4. **Monitoring**: Set up logging and monitoring for subscription events
5. **Analytics**: Track conversion rates and subscription metrics

## Technical Notes

- All API routes use dynamic imports to prevent build-time Firebase initialization issues
- Subscription data is stored in Firebase Firestore under `users/{userId}/subscription`
- BYOK detection happens client-side and is passed to Stripe as metadata
- Customer portal sessions automatically redirect back to the account page
- Webhook events include comprehensive logging for debugging and monitoring

This implementation provides a robust, scalable foundation for subscription billing that can be easily extended with additional features like usage tracking, multiple billing cycles, or enterprise custom pricing.
