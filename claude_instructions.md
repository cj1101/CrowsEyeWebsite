Please refer to our screen recordings (link to be provided with submission, based on `docs/screen_recording_script.md`) for visual demonstrations of these flows.

* **A. Connecting Accounts & Basic Info (`instagram_basic`, `pages_read_engagement`):**
    1.  Launch Crow's Eye.
    2.  Use the "Login" button (or equivalent) to initiate Meta OAuth flow.
    3.  Grant requested permissions.
    4.  Verify display of basic Instagram account info (username, profile pic) and Facebook Page details, confirming `instagram_basic` and `pages_read_engagement` for account verification. [cite: cj1101/offlinefinal/offlineFinal-f394dce6bfb645fc141c5759772535b6fdd8e3aa/docs/meta_compliance.md]

* **B. Content Creation & Publishing (`instagram_content_publish`):**
    1.  Navigate to the main content creation area.
    2.  Upload a test image/video to the Media Library. [cite: cj1101/offlinefinal/offlineFinal-f394dce6bfb645fc141c5759772535b6fdd8e3aa/CROWSEYE_README.md]
    3.  Use the Smart Gallery Generator with a prompt (e.g., "best image for a product launch"). [cite: cj1101/offlinefinal/offlineFinal-f394dce6bfb645fc141c5759772535b6fdd8e3aa/CROWSEYE_README.md]
    4.  Generate a caption using AI, possibly with a tone prompt. [cite: cj1101/offlinefinal/offlineFinal-f394dce6bfb645fc141c5759772535b6fdd8e3aa/CROWSEYE_README.md]
    5.  Select post format (e.g., Single Image).
    6.  Click "Post Now." Verify content publishes to the connected Instagram Business Account. This demonstrates `instagram_content_publish`. [cite: cj1101/offlinefinal/offlineFinal-f394dce6bfb645fc141c5759772535b6fdd8e3aa/docs/app_review_documentation.md]

* **C. Managing Comments (`instagram_manage_comments`):**
    1.  On a test post published via Crow's Eye, add a comment using a different Instagram account.
    2.  In Crow's Eye, navigate to the relevant post or an "Engagement" section.
    3.  Verify the app retrieves and displays the new comment, demonstrating `instagram_manage_comments` for reading. [cite: cj1101/offlinefinal/offlineFinal-f394dce6bfb645fc141c5759772535b6fdd8e3aa/docs/app_review_documentation.md]
    4.  If testing replies (related to `instagram_business_manage_messages`): Use the app's interface to draft and send a reply to the comment. Verify the reply appears on Instagram.

* **D. Viewing Insights (`instagram_manage_insights`):**
    1.  After generating some engagement on test posts, navigate to an "Analytics" or "Insights" section in Crow's Eye.
    2.  Verify the app displays performance metrics (e.g., reach, impressions). This demonstrates `instagram_manage_insights`. [cite: cj1101/offlinefinal/offlineFinal-f394dce6bfb645fc141c5759772535b6fdd8e3aa/docs/app_review_documentation.md]

* **E. Managing Messages (`instagram_business_manage_messages`):**
    1.  Send a Direct Message (DM) to the connected Instagram Business Account from a separate test Instagram account.
    2.  In Crow's Eye, navigate to the "Inbox" or "Messages" area.
    3.  Verify the app displays the incoming DM.
    4.  Test the "Knowledge Function" (if applicable):
        * Ensure knowledge base files are set up in the app's settings if this feature is being demonstrated.
        * Observe if a reply is drafted based on the DM and knowledge base.
        * Review, edit (optional), and approve the drafted reply to send it.
    5.  Alternatively, manually compose and send a reply to the DM.
    6.  Verify the sent reply appears in the Instagram DM conversation. This flow demonstrates `instagram_business_manage_messages` for reading and sending DMs. [cite: cj1101/offlinefinal/offlineFinal-f394dce6bfb645fc141c5759772535b6fdd8e3aa/docs/app_review_documentation.md]
