# Backend Migration Notice

## ⚠️ Backend No Longer Required

**Important Update:** The Crow's Eye Web Application has been refactored to eliminate the need for a custom backend API. The application now uses direct third-party API integrations.

## What Changed

### Previous Architecture
- Custom FastAPI backend (`api_backend/`)
- PostgreSQL/SQLite database
- Custom authentication system
- API proxy layer

### New Architecture
- Direct Firebase integration for auth and storage
- Direct Google Gemini AI integration
- Direct social platform API calls
- No custom backend required

## Migration Completed

The following services have been replaced:

1. **Authentication** → Firebase Auth
2. **Media Storage** → Firebase Storage + Firestore
3. **AI Services** → Direct Google Gemini API
4. **Social Platforms** → Direct platform APIs
5. **User Management** → Firebase Auth + Firestore

## For Developers

### If you were using the old backend:
1. **Stop the backend server** - it's no longer needed
2. **Update environment variables** - see `env.template` for new requirements
3. **Use the new unified API** - import from `@/services/api`

### Environment Setup
```bash
# Copy the new environment template
cp env.template .env.local

# Configure your API keys:
# - Firebase credentials
# - Gemini API key
# - Social platform API keys
```

### Development Commands
```bash
# Start the application (frontend only)
npm run dev

# Deploy to Firebase Hosting
npm run deploy
```

## Benefits of the New Architecture

✅ **Reduced Complexity** - No backend to maintain  
✅ **Better Performance** - Direct API calls  
✅ **Lower Costs** - No backend hosting  
✅ **Improved Reliability** - Leverage platform SLAs  
✅ **Enhanced Security** - Platform-native authentication  

## Need Help?

- Check the updated `API_REQUIREMENTS.md` for the new architecture
- Review service implementations in `src/services/`
- All existing frontend functionality is preserved

The migration is complete and the application is ready to use!
