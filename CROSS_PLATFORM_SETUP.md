# Cross-Platform Setup Guide

This guide ensures your Crow's Eye Website works reliably across all platforms, browsers, and locations.

## üö® Critical Issues Fixed

The following issues were causing the "black screen with code" problem:

1. **Firebase Configuration Failures**: Missing or invalid environment variables
2. **Hardcoded Localhost URLs**: Services trying to connect to localhost from remote locations
3. **Error Boundary CSS Dependencies**: Custom CSS classes not loading properly in error states
4. **Network Compatibility**: CORS and network configuration issues

## üîß Required Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in your project root with these variables:

```bash
# Firebase Configuration (REQUIRED)
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your-actual-firebase-api-key
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your-project.firebaseapp.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your-project.appspot.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=123456789
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID=1:123456789:web:abcdef123456

# API Configuration (Optional - will use production endpoint if not set)
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://us-central1-crows-eye-website.cloudfunctions.net

# Development Only (Optional)
NEXT_PUBLIC_USE_FIREBASE_EMULATOR=false
```

## üåç Cross-Platform Compatibility Features

### 1. Dynamic API URL Resolution
- **Production**: Always uses deployed Firebase Cloud Functions
- **Development on localhost**: Uses local emulator if available
- **Development on network**: Uses production endpoint (prevents localhost issues)

### 2. Robust Firebase Initialization
- Safe initialization that works across all environments
- Graceful fallback to demo mode if configuration is missing
- Enhanced error handling and logging

### 3. Enhanced Error Boundaries
- Uses inline styles instead of CSS classes for reliability
- Multiple recovery options (refresh, retry, go home)
- Better error messages for different platforms

### 4. Network-Aware Authentication
- Detects network connectivity issues
- Provides specific error messages for different failure modes
- Graceful degradation when services are unavailable

## üöÄ Deployment Checklist

### Before Deployment:
1. ‚úÖ Set all required environment variables
2. ‚úÖ Test Firebase configuration
3. ‚úÖ Verify API endpoints are accessible
4. ‚úÖ Test from different networks/locations
5. ‚úÖ Check mobile compatibility

### After Deployment:
1. ‚úÖ Test account creation from different browsers
2. ‚úÖ Test from different geographical locations
3. ‚úÖ Verify mobile responsiveness
4. ‚úÖ Test with slow internet connections
5. ‚úÖ Verify error handling works properly

## üîç Debugging Issues

### Check Configuration Status
The app now logs detailed configuration information in development mode. Open browser console to see:
- Firebase configuration status
- API endpoint being used
- Feature flags status
- Environment detection

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### Issue: Black screen on signup/login
**Solutions:**
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify Firebase environment variables are set
3. Check network connectivity
4. Try refreshing the page
5. Clear browser cache/cookies

#### Issue: "Authentication service not available"
**Solutions:**
1. Verify Firebase project configuration
2. Check if Firebase services are enabled
3. Ensure API keys are valid
4. Check network firewall settings

#### Issue: Network errors from different locations
**Solutions:**
1. Verify CORS settings in Firebase
2. Check if API endpoints are publicly accessible
3. Ensure no hardcoded localhost URLs
4. Test with different DNS servers

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Setup

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Copy environment template
cp env.template .env.local

# Edit .env.local with your actual values
nano .env.local

npm run dev
```

## üèóÔ∏è Production Deployment

```bash
# Build the application
npm run build

# Deploy to Firebase Hosting
npm run deploy

# Or deploy everything (hosting + functions)
npm run deploy:full
```
